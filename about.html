        <div class="philosophy-content">
          <p>We don't believe in one-size-fits-all solutions or quick fixes that don't last. Our approach is built on three core principles that set us apart from traditional fitness programs.</p>
          
          <div class="philosophy-grid">
            <div class="philosophy-item">
              <h3>Sustainable Results Over Quick Fixes</h3>
              <p>We focus on building habits and lifestyle changes that you can maintain long-term. No extreme diets or impossible workout schedules that leave you burned out after a few weeks.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="philosophy-item">
              <h3>Cultural Food Integration</h3>
              <p>We understand that South Asian cuisine is rich in flavor and tradition. Our approach helps you maintain cultural food connections while building sustainable eating habits that support your fitness goals.</p>

            <h3>Arjav's Story</h3>
            <div class="journey-content">
              <p>At just 16 years old, Arjav began his fitness journey and successfully lost 60 pounds. Behind that transformation came challenges: extreme dieting and the struggles of an eating disorder. Determined to find a healthier way, he immersed himself in fitness and nutrition research, which sparked a lifelong passion for bodybuilding and wellness.</p>
              <p>After completing his NASM certification, Arjav began by training clients in person, channeling his personal experiences into helping others avoid the same pitfalls. In 2022, he founded JAV Coaching with a clear mission: to tackle the very struggles he once faced and empower others to achieve lasting results through sustainable fitness and nutrition.</p>

            <h3>Bhargava's Story</h3>
            <div class="journey-content">
              <p>Bhargava began his fitness journey in high school after years of struggling with being severely underweight. Born with multiple food allergies, he was forced to adapt to strict dietary restrictions while finding ways to build muscle, gain weight, and create a sustainable healthy lifestyle. Over time, this challenge fueled his passion for bodybuilding, health, and overall wellness.</p>
              <p>Since then, Bhargava has continued to pursue his own wellness goals while coaching and supporting individuals from diverse backgrounds and lifestyles. In partnership with Arjav, he has guided clients through weight loss, muscle gain, and long-term habit building—helping them prioritize wellness, improve confidence, and embrace healthier lifestyles in every aspect of their lives.</p>
